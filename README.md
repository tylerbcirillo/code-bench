# code-bench

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown. 
  
  - Click any text cell to edit it
  - The code in each editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell 
  - You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the show function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values 
  - Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell 
  
 All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran npx jbook-tylerbc serve test.js, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the test.js file
